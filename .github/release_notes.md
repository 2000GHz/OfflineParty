### Release Notes for version 1.3.3


**Changes**

1. `download.py`
   - Fixed issue where the artist's name wasn't being correctly obtained

**Notes (Apply for version 1.3.x)**

1. This is a bit of a rushed release, I haven't had much time to test it, so hopefully we won't have many issues.

2. In any case, expect patch releases where I polish the code further!

3. Lastly, I will soon be enabling a discussion thread so you can ask any questions, suggest new features or simply post your errors so I can work on them
