### Release Notes for version 1.4.6

**Changes**

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Reduced code redundancy in `discord_download.py`
- Changed default discord download setting to store all channel posts in the channel folder, removed the prompt at first run
=======
- Fixed a small issue with the URL parsing regex that wouldn't allow for search of URLs if the username contained a period "." in their names.

**Thanks**

- To @syrexw for reporting the issue

Greatly appreciated! Your suggestions help make the program more and more useful for users to come

Also, happy new year everyone!! I'll try to catch up with this project as with holidays and work it's been left sort of unupdated, also... after the domain changes I know this repo name, OfflineParty doesn't really make much sense anymore, but I still think it's kinda catchy so I think I'll just keep it
