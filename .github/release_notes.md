### Release Notes for version 1.4.5

**Changes**

- Added file size limits, any file that goes over or under them will be skipped
- Added file type selection, this way you can choose to download only the videos, pictures or other kind of documents from one user
- Added the choice to create or not create a folder for every post, essentially dumping all posts in the artist folder or in a folder for each post, which was the current behavior
- File sizes are now float values, so you can use decimals (Using points . as separators), this will help better control your limitations

**Thanks**

- To @neonmaus for suggesting the file type filter
- To @JamiDEV for suggesting the file size limitations

Greatly appreciated! Your suggestions help make the program more and more useful for users to come

**Future patches**

- Polishing of code
- Merging of discord and download
- Modularization, should help contributors and myself understand the code better (Even I get lost sometimes, it's a goddarn mess lmao, I'm sorry)

Please notify me of any bugs you may encounter! I'm sort of busy at the moment and am not working as actively in this project at the moment.
I will gladly take a look at it and try to fix stuff up.
