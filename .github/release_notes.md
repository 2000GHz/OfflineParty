### Release Notes for version 1.3.1

**New Functionalities**

1. `discord_download.py`
   - Creating temp download files in case the user interrupts the download or there is any kind of issue
2. `download.py`
   - Same thing as discord download

**Changes**

1. Various modifications to existing scripts to handle the new discord download process

**Notes (Apply for version 1.3.x)**

1. This is a bit of a rushed release, I haven't had much time to test it, so hopefully we won't have many issues.

2. In any case, expect patch releases where I polish the code further!

3. Lastly, I will soon be enabling a discussion thread so you can ask any questions, suggest new features or simply post your errors so I can work on them
