I want you to add a new flag, -u or --user, I will explain the way I think is best suited for this, but I'm open for suggestions

1. Ask the user for the name or URL of the artist page
2. If the user inputs the name, we shall run get_favorites for both coomer and kemono to try to find a match. We can search for this match using the lookup_and_save_user function from json_handling we can parse the generated dictionary, and from the data stored there craft a URL
3. With that URL, we can run the get_all_page_urls function from get_favorites.py to find all pages that we need to download from the requested user. However, if the user directly inputs the URL of the artist, we can skip step 2
3. Feed the resulting list of URLs to be downloaded to download.py

Also, VERY IMPORTANT, don't modify the already existing logic of the scripts, just adapt them if necessary to implement the new requirements

Hope I was clear enough and I hope you can help me! I've attached all the relevant files to aid you

Lastly, to help with your quotas, you can minimize your answers to just the fixes and make them one at a time, for every script where changes need applying. And allow me to download the files after you applied said modifications.
